Change Log
----------

## Version 0.1
This is the initial release. The extension works when the developer tools are opened. It reads the page, searches for stylesheets and tries to determine if the css contains sass debug info.

If the stylesheets are generated with sass a static page is added to the Saas sidebar. The sidebar only exist if pages have the sass debug info.

For a test page go to http://ketalo.com/chromesass/test.html
